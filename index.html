I am a sample app.<br><br>

Here is how I was born;<br>
<ol>
<li>Jenkins pulled all of my files from Github and saved it in the Jenkins server.</li>
<li>Jenkins used my war to create a Docker image with the help of Ansible.</li>
<li>Jenkins send my image to Docker Registry using Ansible.</li>
<li>Jenkins called Ansible again to create a container of me in the Docker server.</li>
<li>Find me at http://docker_server/sample/.</li>
</ol>
